# Project Overview
The primary objective is to evaluate automation opportunities that reduce processing time and optimize resource allocation. The analysis is based on the **BPI Challenge 2017** event log, specifically the Application log from a large Dutch financial institution
- Machine Learning-Based Prioritization: A model to predict applications with the highest probability of successful completion.
- Automation Assessment: A goal model to identify activities suitable for automation based on frequency, temporal stability, and resource concentration.
- Process Redesign: A modified BPMN model that aligns process improvements with strategic business objectives.

# Repository Structure
- `source/`: This folder contains the Python source code used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of the machine learning prioritization framework.
- `report.pdf`: The full technical documentation of the study.
- `presentation.pdf`: The slides used for the project presentation
- `original automation cluster.bpmn` and `developed_cluster_model.bpmn`: The BPMN models (the one developed by the winners of the challenge and the one with our improvements)

# Contributions
The project was carried out with my colleagues Ilaria Boschetto, Federico Clerici, Raffaele D'Agostino and Davide Volpi
